# FastImageTV

Allows you to add pictures to TV without calling the file manager. 
Images are uploaded to locations defined in config files.

## Features

- Pictures are uploaded with ajax into the folders specified in the settings, dragging also works, and transliteration is supported.
- You can use placeholders (manager id, date part, document id, document parent id, random sequence) in the names of folders and files.
- For each TV you can set your own settings or override the default settings.
- Unnecessary pictures are deleted when the document is saved.
- You can configure the conversion of pictures both on the server and on the client side.
- You can crop the preview when loading.

At the same time, full compatibility with regular TV of the image type is preserved.
